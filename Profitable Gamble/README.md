# A profitable gamble

This is a game that yields a positive net profit, 
where net profit is calculated in the following manner: 
net_outcome = probability_of_winning * prize - cost_of_playing.

The function takes three arguments prob, prize, pay and 
returns true if prob * prize > pay; otherwise return false.
